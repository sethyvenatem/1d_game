# 1d_game
I'm making typing game with python based on the print() function.

The game interface is a string that is changed at each time step and displayed in the console.

Getting a real-time keyboard input is quite hard. I explored multiple packages:
- select
- keyboard
- pygame
- getch (which is my best bet for now)
