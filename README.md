# 1d_game
As a fun exercise, I'm trying to make a typing game with python based on the print() function. The game interface is a string that is changed at each time step and displayed in the console.

I was able to make an animation with a canon shooting a letter across the screen.

Getting a real-time keyboard input is quite hard. I explored multiple packages:
- select
- keyboard
- pygame
- getch (which is my best bet for now). Actually, this does not work

I could do it with the keyboard module.
